# Core idea of this project:

I wanted to create something fairly simple to understand the core logic behind the solana network and data storage.
What I managed to complete in a fast short term is this which includes the following functionalities:

- [x] Create a Blog Account (Your private account linked with your PubKey)
- [x] Create a tweet (Tweet that is minted on the blockchain and is linked with your PubKey)
- [x] Edit a tweet (Checks if you are the author and changes the Title and Content of an existing tweet)

## Further plans for this project:

Currently I have no plans to continue working on this, since as I said I did it to learn the basics of SOL and how anchor behaves as a wrapper behind the scenes for the core solana lib.
Feel free to use this as a boilerplate for a Blog app or just as a reference to see how you are performing.
